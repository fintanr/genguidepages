# Generate Guide Pages for use with Jekyll #

Takes a set of README.md files from subdirectorys in a repo and sets them up
for use with jekyll, kramdown and pygment. 

We read our configuration details and output file names in from a json file.

Its pretty specific to a use case I currently have, but feel free to grab and use 
as you see fit.
